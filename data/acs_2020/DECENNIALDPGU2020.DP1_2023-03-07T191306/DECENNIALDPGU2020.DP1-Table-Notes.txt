[7] "Spouse" represents spouse of the householder.  It does not reflect all spouses in a household.<br/><br/>

[6] This category includes people who reported Cuban, Spaniard, and other detailed Hispanic responses. It also includes people who reported "Hispanic" or "Latino" and other general terms.<br/><br/>

[5] The most common reported Hispanic origin group in the 2010 Census of Guam.<br/><br/>

[4] "Other races alone or in combination" includes respondents who reported one race group or multiple race groups that were not classified as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander or Asian (e.g., White <b><i>and</i></b> a Black or African American group such as Jamaican), as well as respondents who reported one group that was not classified as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander or Asian and another that was classified as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander or Asian (e.g., Jamaican <b><i>and</i></b> Chamorro).<br/><br/>

[3] "Asian alone or in combination" includes respondents who reported an Asian group alone (e.g., Filipino), multiple Asian groups (e.g., Filipino and Korean), as well as respondents who reported an Asian group and one or more other groups classified as another race (e.g., Filipino <b><i>and</i></b> White).<br/><br/>

[2] "Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone or in combination" includes respondents who reported a Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander group alone (e.g., Chamorro), multiple Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander groups (e.g., Chamorro and Chuukese), as well as respondents who reported one Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander group and one or more other groups classified as another race (e.g., Chamorro <b><i>and</i></b> White).<br/><br/>

[1] People who reported multiple responses may be counted in more than one of the race alone or in combination categories. For example, a respondent reporting Chamorro <b><i>and</i></b> Filipino is counted in the "Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone or in combination" category, the "Chamorro alone or in any combination" category, the "Asian alone or in combination" category, and the "Filipino alone or in any combination" category. These categories may add to more than the total population.<br/><br/>

Due to COVID-19 restrictions impacting data collection for the 2020 Census of Guam, data users should consider the following when using Guam's data products: <TABLE><TR><TD></TD><TD> 1) Data tables reporting social and economic characteristics do not include the group quarters population in the table universe. As a result, impacted 2020 data tables should not be compared to 2010 and other past census data tables reporting the same characteristics. The Census Bureau advises data users to verify table universes are the same before comparing data across census years. For more information about data collection limitations and the impacts on Guam's data products, see the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/technical-documentation/island-areas-censuses.html">2020 Island Areas Censuses Technical Documentation</a>. <br><br> </TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD> 2) Cells in data tables will display the letter "N" when those data are not statistically reliable. A list of the geographic areas and data tables that will not have data displayed due to data quality concerns can be found in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/technical-documentation/island-areas-censuses.html">2020 Island Areas Censuses Technical Documentation</a>.</a> <br><br> </TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD> 3) The Census Bureau advises that data users consider high allocation rates while using the 2020 Census of Guam's available characteristics data. Allocation rates -- a measure of item nonresponse -- are higher than past censuses. Final counts can be adversely impacted when an item's allocation rate is high, and bias can be introduced if the characteristics of the nonrespondents differ from those reported by respondents. Allocation rates for Guam's key population and housing characteristics can be found in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/technical-documentation/island-areas-censuses.html">2020 Island Areas Censuses Technical Documentation</a>. </TD></TR></TABLE><br/><br/>

[8] "Family households" consist of a householder and one or more other people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption.<br/><br/>

Due to operational changes for military installation enumeration, the 2020 Census of Guam data tables reporting housing, social, and economic characteristics do not include housing units or populations living on Guam's U.S. military installations in the table universe. As a result, impacted 2020 data tables should not be compared to 2010 and other past census data tables reporting the same characteristics. The Census Bureau advises data users to verify table universes are the same before comparing data across census years. For more information about operational changes and the impacts on Guam's data products, see the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/technical-documentation/island-areas-censuses.html">2020 Island Areas Censuses Technical Documentation</a>.<br/><br/>
