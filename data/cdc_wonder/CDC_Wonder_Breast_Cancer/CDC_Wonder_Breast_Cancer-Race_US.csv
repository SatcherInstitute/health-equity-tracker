"1. Data for in situ breast cancers are listed separately and are not included in the ""All Invasive Cancer Sites Combined"" or",,,,,,,,,,,
"""Male and Female Breast"" cancer categories.",,,,,,,,,,,
---,,,,,,,,,,,
Caveats:,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. 'Not Applicable' is displayed for Population when it is not available, and for Age Adjusted Rates, Crude Rates, 95%",,,,,,,,,,,
"Confidence Interval, and Standard Error when they cannot be calculated due to lack of denominator population.",,,,,,,,,,,
"2. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites or by Childhood Cancer, because aggregate",,,,,,,,,,,
values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be,,,,,,,,,,,
misleading.,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet data quality criteria. Incidence data,,,,,,,,,,,
shown for the United States are diagnoses and populations from included registries only.,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Information on primary site, behavior, and histology was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for",,,,,,,,,,,

standard groupings of primary cancer sites.,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and",,,,,,,,,,,
Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for,,,,,,,,,,,

"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005.",,,,,,,,,,,
