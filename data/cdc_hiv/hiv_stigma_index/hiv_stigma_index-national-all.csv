Footnote(s):
Weighted percentages for unstable housing or homelessness and median HIV stigma scores are reported in the ‘Rate per 100,000’ column with corresponding 95% confidence intervals reported in the ‘Rate LCI’ and ‘Rate UCI’ columns within the Charts and Maps tools or in parentheses within the ‘Rate per 100,000’ column within the Tables tool.
To allow for comparison with other HIV indicators, data are presented for persons aged ≥13 years and aged 13-24 years. However, these estimates are representative of persons with diagnosed HIV aged ≥18 years and 18-24 years, respectively.
For unstable housing or homelessness, estimates with a coefficient of variation ≥0.30 or those based on a denominator sample size less than 30 were suppressed. For HIV stigma, estimates based on a denominator sample size less than 30 were suppressed.
See Technical Notes for more details on data availability, stratifications, and variable definitions.
* Estimates with an absolute CI width ≥30, estimates with an absolute CI width between 5 and 30 and a relative CI width greater than 130%, and estimates of 0% or 100% should be interpreted with caution. Currently, this applies to one estimate: Unstable Housing or Homelessness, 2018, United States, persons aged 18-24 years [reported in the 13-24 year age group].
The 'Sex' column is used for either sex at birth or gender identity.
NA - Not applicable.
