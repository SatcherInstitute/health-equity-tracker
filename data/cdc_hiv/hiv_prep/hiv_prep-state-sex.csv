Footnote(s): PrEP coverage, reported as a percentage, is calculated as the number of persons aged &ge;16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP divided by the estimated number of persons aged &ge;16 years who had indications for PrEP. Number prescribed, or “cases”, is defined as the number of persons aged &ge;16 years classified as having been prescribed PrEP during the specified year and includes all FDA-approved drugs for PrEP. “Population” is the annual estimated number of persons with PrEP indications. Total includes people categorized by IQVIA as Black, White, Hispanic, or Other race. Race/ethnicity data are adjusted due to large proportion of missing race/ethnicity. To allow for comparison with other HIV indicators, data are presented for &ge;13- and 13–24-year-olds, but represent &ge;16- and 16-24-years-olds, respectively. Number prescribed are reported through June 2022
