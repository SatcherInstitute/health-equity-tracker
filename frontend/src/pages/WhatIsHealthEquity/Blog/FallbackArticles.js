The CDC&#8217;s Case Surveillance Restricted Access and Public Use with Geography datasets are the only available replacements for the Covid Tracking Project&#8217;s dataset, and they additionally include county-level data and age along with race/ethnicity. This paper evaluates the completeness of the CDC datasets at the state and county levels in terms of (1) the total number of cases included compared to the New York Times, and (2) the number of cases included with race/ethnicity data compared to the Covid Tracking Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CDC&#8217;s Restricted Access dataset contains 78% of the cases in the New York Times up to April 15, 2021, and 65% of cases have race/ethnicity information vs. 67% in the Covid Tracking Project. The dataset&#8217;s completeness has steadily and gradually improved over time; e.g., the first available version from May 2020 had race/ethnicity information for only 43% of cases. At the state and county levels, the dataset&#8217;s completeness has also improved with a state-level average of 62% of cases with race/ethnicity in April 2021 vs. 46% in June 2020. However, the dataset&#8217;s completeness at the state level is highly variable; for example, Minnesota has 102% of the cases included in the New York Times, while Louisiana has only 4% of the cases in the New York Times. Minnesota has 91% of cases with race/ethnicity, while Louisiana has only 19% with race/ethnicity (vs. 94% in the Covid Tracking Project). Texas alone is missing 2.8M cases, accounting for more than a third of the total 7.1M missing cases. New York is missing race/ethnicity for 1.3M cases and California for 1.1M cases, accounting for more than a quarter of the 8.6M cases missing race/ethnicity when combined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CDC&#8217;s Public Use with Geography dataset is similar to the Restricted Access dataset for total case counts, but is less complete due to more privacy suppression; e.g., only 49% of cases have race/ethnicity information.</p>\n',

Unfortunately, in many cases data has erased diversity by collapsing distinct groups of people into “convenient” categories for statistical purposes. This erasure frequently occurs when people from across the Americas are all labeled as Hispanic/Latinx, when hundreds of distinct tribal communities are all coded as American Indian, or when everyone who is not cis-gender or heterosexual is grouped together as LGBTQ+. Sometimes these groupings reflect coalitions amongst its members, and strength in numbers can lead to power to advocate for change. However, these data are superficial and generalize incredibly diverse communities. So, instead of perpetuating erasure or stereotypes for statistical convenience, how can data be used to advance equity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It starts with recognizing the need to balance the accumulation of data with respecting the needs and desires of the community. As researchers, we frequently want more data but need to ask ourselves some questions such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What burden does data collection place on the community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who is participating and who is excluded from the decision making?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this information already exist elsewhere?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would knowing this information inform our policies and programming?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the consequences of collecting this data?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How will results be communicated back to the community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, it is essential that health departments working with their cross-sectoral partners consider how data can be collected and used both internally and externally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, when public health professionals speak about data collection, they are referring to learning more about a specific population in their jurisdiction. But to truly advance equity, public health professionals need to look inward at the deep-seated roots of health inequity that may exist within their own organizations and understand how they might be inadvertently perpetuating structural racism, white supremacy, and discrimination internally through their policies, procedures, and practices. This could be reflected in racial differences in leadership compared to frontline staff, in pay differences between staff with similar job titles but different genders, or in the history and composition of community partners who may or may not be rooted in the communities we are asking them to serve. For health departments to truly advance equity, they should lead by example in becoming fully inclusive, anti-racist, multicultural organizations that have not only diversity, equity, and inclusion, but also justice built into their DNA.<a href="https://satcherinstitute.org/hetblog3/#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;To do that, equity considerations must be incorporated into the day-to-day activities and operations of every staff member at all levels of the organization. One way to operationalize equity is to use resources such as the Racial Equity Toolkit from the Government Alliance on Race &amp; Equity (GARE). This tremendous tool provides a step-by-step approach to put equity into practice.<a href="https://satcherinstitute.org/hetblog3/#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey from hegemonic white supremacy to total equity and justice is long, but there are many ways that data can be used to help advance this work internally. Survey data and statistics on hiring, promotions, and retention collected longitudinally can track some metrics of staffing equity over time. Qualitative data collection can be used to better understand the work environment, how toxic it is, the frequency and types of aggressions experienced, and the impact on staff wellness, safety, morale, and retention. These data can also be used to develop programs to mentor and support staff from under-resourced communities, to create conflict resolution mechanisms based on mediation and relationship healing in the face of power differences, and to develop educational resources to relieve people of color from the dual role of victim and teacher so other staff can do the work needed to challenge the modern American caste system. In the end, data is a double-edged sword that can perpetuate inequities or advance equity and justice. It just depends on how you use it. We choose to ask tough questions, challenge the status quo, and seek real change. What will you choose?<a href="https://satcherinstitute.org/hetblog3/#_ftnref1"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://satcherinstitute.org/hetblog3/#_ftnref1">[1]</a>Continuum on Becoming an Anti-Racist Multicultural Organization&nbsp;(<a href="https://philanos.org/resources/Documents/Conference%202020/Pre-Read%20PDFs/Continuum_AntiRacist.pdf">https://philanos.org/resources/Documents/Conference%202020/Pre-Read%20PDFs/Continuum_AntiRacist.pdf</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://satcherinstitute.org/hetblog3/#_ftnref2">[2]</a>GARE Racial Equity Toolkit (<a href="https://www.racialequityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GARE-Racial_Equity_Toolkit.pdf">https://www.racialequityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GARE-Racial_Equity_Toolkit.pdf</a>)</p>\n',

The statute called for&nbsp;<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/hhs-implementation-guidance-data-collection-standards-race-ethnicity-sex-primary-language-and-disability-status">standardizing how these key characteristics</a>&nbsp;were to be defined and those definitions were published and ready for implementation by 2011. The vision was for uniform, ongoing data on health and wellbeing metrics that could be used in targeting federal resources and programs to address inequities due to social and economic factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next decade, there was modest progress in integrating these standard measures into data collection systems.&nbsp; Also, the standard definitions continued to evolve as the U.S. population became more diverse and as we learned more sensitive ways to accurately define and capture our country’s data on race, gender, and disability diversity, and, in particular, in relation to distinguishing inequities. In tracking some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/datasets.html">specific progress</a>, we now have a number of federal statistical surveys, surveillance systems, and health and other programs, that have incorporated the U.S Department of Health and Human Services’ recommended standard question set for disability identifiers. These data allow for more meaningful strategies to be implemented to reach people with various types of disability across federal, state, local and other jurisdictional programs and policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, during emergency response situations, the focus of those on the front line&#8211;in the field, in the clinics, and in public health&#8211;is on reporting accurately the specifics of the disease, with less focus on who is impacted.&nbsp; In the context of COVID-19, all the focus early on in the pandemic was to better describe this newly emerging disease. Depending on how dire the circumstances, obtaining descriptive information may require some guessing on the part of the person who is completing the case report form, something they may be reluctant or instructed not to do. To compound this challenge, there may be a reluctance by those who are being asked to disclose their personal information, to not want to do so.&nbsp; Why this happens is multifactorial &#8212; fear of stigmatization, fear of retaliation&#8211;in general, not feeling safe to disclose personal information.&nbsp; It may be safer and easier to leave that information blank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a society we need to understand and communicate why information on race and ethnicity, gender diversity, and disability status matters—to members of these groups, to those who are tasked with eliciting the information, and to all of us who want to address equity head on.&nbsp; For the most part, these four constructs represent groups of individuals who because of experiences, lack of opportunities, and threats, have been historically marginalized.&nbsp; These basic descriptive constructs, measured well, will allow us to hold ourselves accountable for ensuring an equitable response and outcome—both during times of emergency as well as outside of that context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coleen A. Boyle, PhD, MS Hyg</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Boyle is an adjunct professor in the Center for Leadership in Disability at the<br>Georgia State University School of Public Health and serves as the COVID-19 Research Advisor at the CDC Foundation. Dr. Boyle began her public health career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in1984 as part of a large effort to study the adverse health effects of exposure to Agent Orange, an herbicide used during the Vietnam War. Following that project, she joined CDC’s work in birth defects and developmental disabilities holding various positions of increasing responsibility until her appointment as the Director of CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Disabilities in 2010. She held that position until her retirement from CDC in early 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Boyle’s interest and expertise span a number of areas related to child health and disability. She directed a major public health response on cochlear implants and risk of meningitis, resulting in the recall of a particular implant device and helped guide the Nation’s emergency response on reducing the potentially devastating impact of the Zika virus on birth defects and child development. Dr. Boyle led the development of CDC’s autism research and surveillance activities that have documented the changing<br>prevalence of autism in the United States and she contributed widely to the field of newborn screening overseeing CDC’s work in newborn hearing and congenital heart disorder screening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Boyle was trained in epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh, School of Public Health and did postdoctoral work at the Yale School of Public Health. She has twice awarded CDC’s highest recognition for scientific excellence, the Charles C. Shepard Award, for her scientific work and on her retirement from CDC was honored<br>with the Excellence in Public Health Service Award by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the HRSA Maternal and Child Health Bureau Title V Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>\n',
