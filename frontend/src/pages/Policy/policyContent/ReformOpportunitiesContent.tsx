        ERPOs, also known as "red flag laws," allow for the temporary removal of
        firearms from individuals deemed to be a risk to themselves or others.
        This study would assess how effective these orders are in reducing gun
        violence.

        the transfer of certain firearms and related items, such as
        semiautomatic firearms, silencers, armor-piercing ammunition, or large
        capacity ammunition magazines. The waiting period could serve as a
        cooling-off time to prevent impulsive acts of violence and ensure
        thorough background checks.
