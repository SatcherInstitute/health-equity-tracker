    question: 'How is youth-related violence addressed in the data?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Our dataset on youth-related gun violence specifically addresses gun
        deaths among two age groups: children (0-17) and young adults (18-25).
        For both age groups, the data is broken down by race and ethnicity,
        providing insights into the racial and ethnic disparities that may exist
        in gun-related deaths. However, the dataset does not currently include
        other potential breakdowns, such as gender, socioeconomic status, or
        geographic location.‚Äù
