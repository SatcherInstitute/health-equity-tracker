        <p>
          Our dataset on youth-related gun violence specifically addresses gun
          deaths among two age groups: <strong>children (0-17)</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>young adults (18-25)</strong>.

          For both age groups, the data is broken down by race and ethnicity,
          providing insights into the racial and ethnic disparities that may
          exist in gun-related deaths.

        <p>
          However, the dataset does not currently include other potential
          breakdowns, such as gender, socioeconomic status, or geographic classification (metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan).
