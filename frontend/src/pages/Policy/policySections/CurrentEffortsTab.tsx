          This approach advocates for holistic solutions that address the root
          causes of gun violence, which are often found in the systemic
          inequities plaguing these communities.The patterns observed in Atlanta
          reflect a broader narrative of health inequity, where the determinants
          of health unfairly disadvantage certain groups, leading to disparities
          in violence exposure.
