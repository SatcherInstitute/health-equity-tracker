      <p>
        It's important to note that because BRFSS is survey-based, it sometimes
        lacks sufficient data for smaller or marginalized racial groups, making
        some estimates less statistically robust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the America's Health Rankings analysis of BRFSS data is
        not available at the county level, limiting our tracker's granularity
        for these metrics.
