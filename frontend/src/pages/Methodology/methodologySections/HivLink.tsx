          The CDC's National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB

            The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted data for the year
            2020. This impact could lead to distortions in the reported numbers.
            Please exercise caution when analyzing this year's data.
          </p>
        </HetNotice>
        <p>
          The data for 2022 and 2023 is still in its initial stages of
          collection and has not been finalized, making it "preliminary."
          Single-year figures refer to data that represents just one specific
          year, rather than an average or cumulative total over multiple years.
          Given the preliminary status of the 2022 and 2023 data, we've opted to
          use 2021 as our reference year when showcasing data from a single

        <h4 className='text-text font-normal'>HIV Diagnosis</h4>
        <p>
          Refers to confirmed HIV infections via laboratory or clinical evidence
          within a specific calendar year. Counts are for individuals aged 13 or
          older diagnosed with HIV during the year. Age is determined by the
          person's age at the time of infection. All metrics sourced from the
          CDC for HIV deaths are calculated directly from the raw count of those
          cases.
        </p>
        <h4 className='text-text font-normal'>HIV Prevalence</h4>
        <p>
          Represents estimated individuals aged 13 and older living with HIV by
          the year's end. Accounts for both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases.
          Adjusted using the total number of diagnosed cases and subsequent
          deaths from CDC’s Atlas database. The Asian category includes cases
          classified as "Asian/Pacific Islander" using the pre-1997 OMB
          race/ethnicity system when querying HIV prevalence. HIV prevalence
          metrics are determined by estimating the total number of individuals
          who have ever been infected with HIV (diagnosed and undiagnosed cases)
          and then adjusting for the reported total number of people diagnosed
          with HIV and subsequently died provided by the CDC’s Atlas database.
        </p>
        <h4 className='text-text font-normal'>HIV Deaths</h4>
        <p>
          Counts deaths of persons aged 13 and older with diagnosed HIV or AIDS,
          irrespective of death cause. Data has a 12-month reporting delay for
          CDC reporting. Age is determined by the person's age at the time of
          death. All metrics sourced from the CDC for HIV deaths are calculated
          directly from the raw count of those cases.

          To calculate the percent share of HIV diagnoses, prevalence, or

          in a specific demographic group by the total number of HIV deaths,
          diagnoses, or prevalence and multiply the result by 100.

        <h5>Population percent</h5>
        <p>
          The population data is obtained directly from the CDC. To calculate

          The rate per 100k for HIV diagnoses, prevalence, and deaths, is
          obtained directly from the CDC. Calculating the rate per 100k of HIV
          deaths, diagnoses, or prevalence involves dividing the number of
          deaths, diagnoses, or prevalence within a specific population by the
          total population of that group, multiplying the result by 100,000, and

          Defining PrEP Coverage as a Percentage

          Adequate PrEP coverage is a foundational step towards its utilization.
          If PrEP coverage is insufficient, high-risk individuals might remain
          unaware or lack access to PrEP. Consequently, lower PrEP coverage can
          correlate with reduced PrEP usage, especially in communities with
          limited access.

        <h5>Percent share</h5>

          Linkage to Care

        <p>
          Linkage to HIV care, reported as a percentage, refers to the number of
          persons aged 13 years and older newly diagnosed with HIV, having at
          least one CD4 or viral load test performed within one month of
          diagnosis during the specified year and divided by the number of

        </p>
        <p>
          Linkage to HIV care is a critical step in the HIV care continuum and
          can improve health outcomes for individuals with HIV. When a person
          living with HIV is linked to care soon after their diagnosis, they can
          receive the medical treatment and support they need to manage their
          HIV, reduce the amount of virus in their body, improve their health,
          and lower the risk of transmitting HIV to others. Delayed linkage to
          care can result in poorer health outcomes for individuals living with
          HIV and can increase the risk of transmitting HIV to others.

        <h5>Diagnosed population percent</h5>
        <p>
          Calculating the percent share of the population involves dividing the
          number of individuals within a specific population or demographic
          group with HIV diagnoses by the total number of individuals with HIV
          diagnoses and multiplying the result by 100.

          This percentage is obtained directly from the CDC. It involves
          dividing the number of individuals within a specific population or
          demographic group with access to care at a given time by the total
          number of individuals living with HIV in the same population or
          demographic group and multiplying the result by 100.

        <h5>Relative Inequity</h5>
        <p>
          Calculating the percentage of relative inequity involves subtracting
          the proportion of all individuals with access to care by a specific
          population or group from the proportion of a specific population or
          group in the diagnosed population. The value is divided by the
          proportion of a specific population or group in the diagnosed
          population multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.

          HIV Stigma
        </h3>
        <p>
          HIV stigma, reported as a score, refers to the weighted median score
          on a 10-item scale ranging from 0 (no stigma) to 100 (high stigma)
          among the number of persons aged 18 years and older diagnosed with
          HIV. This measurement captures four dimensions of HIV stigma:
          personalized stigma experienced during the past 12 months, current
          concerns about disclosure, negative self-image, and perceived public
          attitudes towards people living with HIV.
        </p>
        <p>
          HIV stigma is crucial in understanding and addressing the challenges
          faced by individuals living with HIV. By examining stigma, we gain
          insights into the experiences of people with HIV about personalized
          stigma, concerns about disclosure, self-image, and societal attitudes.
          This information helps inform strategies and interventions to reduce
          stigma, promote social support, and improve the well-being of
          individuals living with HIV.
        </p>
        <h4 className='text-text font-normal'>Algorithm</h4>

        <p>
          All metrics related to HIV stigma are calculated based on a national
          probability sample of individuals diagnosed with HIV, and are sourced
          directly from the CDC.
        </p>
        <h5>Stigma score</h5>
        <p>
          Calculating HIV stigma involves determining the weighted median score
          on a 10-item scale among a national probability sample of people with
          diagnosed HIV.
        </p>

        <FormulaFormat
          leftSide='HIV Stigma Score'
          rightSide={[
            {
              numerator: '',
              denominator: 'Weighted Median of Responses on 10-Item Scale',
            },
          ]}
        />
        <p>
          The scores obtained from self-reported data are then analyzed to
          assess the prevalence and impact of HIV stigma.
