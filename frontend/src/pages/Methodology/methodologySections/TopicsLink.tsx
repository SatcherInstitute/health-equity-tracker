          <title>Categories and Limitations - Health Equity Tracker</title>
        </Helmet>
        <h2 className='sr-only'>Categories and Limitations</h2>

        <p>
          The Health Equity Tracker (HET) was initially conceived in 2020 as a
          response to the COVID-19 pandemic to aggregate demographic data from
          severely affected communities. While our tool offers a detailed view
          of health outcomes categorized by race, ethnicity, sex, and other
          significant factors, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations.
          One of the inherent constraints is that the tracker currently
          aggregates data from 18 key sources, including the CDC and the U.S.
          Census Bureau. While these are reputable sources, the availability and
          granularity of data can sometimes be restrictive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our focus extends beyond just pandemic-related statistics; the tracker
          encompasses 215 variables, covering chronic diseases like COPD and
          diabetes, behavioral health indicators such as opioid misuse, and
          social and political determinants including uninsurance rates and
          poverty levels. These topics were deliberately chosen to provide a
          multi-dimensional view of health equity, guiding policymakers towards
          understanding the unique challenges and needs of diverse communities.

        <p>
          One challenge is inconsistent breakdown values across datasets. We do
          our best to standardize the values. However, this may not always be
          possible. This matters most when attempting to join with population
          statistics to compute a rate. For comparing two health outcomes, itâ€™s
          less critical since a visualization can still show the different
          values.
