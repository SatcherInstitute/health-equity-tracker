            We are committed to principles of{' '}
            <em>Transparency & Accountability,</em> <em>Community First</em>,
            and <em>Open Access</em>, engaging closely with diverse communities
            to shape the overall health narrative and drive actionable policies.
            As we continue to expand our data sources and refine our analyses,
            our goal remains to inform and empower policymakers, while
            highlighting disparities and continually measuring progress towards
            health equity.

          <p>
            We need to hear from you. Our team is quickly developing bigger and
            bolder ideas – to expand the tracker not just in terms of breadth of
            health topics covered, but more importantly, in depth – to increase
            the Health Equity Tracker’s utility to reach decision makers at
            every level and especially those involved in advancing policy so
            Health Equity has a seat at the table. We believe data can be
            transformative and that data quality and access is arguably one of
            the most critical determinants of health. We invite you to tell us
            what you are working on to advance Health Equity, and how the we
            might help. In the spirit of collaboration, I hope you will join us
            in saying: <strong>Health Equity for All!</strong>
