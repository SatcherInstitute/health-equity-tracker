                  <li>
                    National statistics are aggregations of state-wide data. If
                    state data is not available, these aggregations may be
                    incomplete and potentially skewed.

                    When calculating national-level per100k COVID-19 rates for
                    cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, we only include the
                    population of states that do not have a suppressed case
                    count as part of the total population. See the 'What data
                    are missing' section for further details.

                    To protect the privacy of affected individuals, COVID-19
                    data may be hidden in counties with low numbers of COVID-19
                    cases, hospitalizations and deaths.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Decisions to suppress COVID-19 data for particular states in
                    the tracker are evaluated by comparing the aggregate case,
                    death, and hospitalization counts in the CDC surveillance
                    dataset vs other sources, such as the New York Times. Data
                    for a state are suppressed if the aggregate counts for that
                    state are &lt; 5% of the source being used for comparison.
                    These analyses are available for{" "}

                    The underlying data is reported at the case-level, so we
                    cannot determine whether a state/county lacking cases for a
                    particular demographic group truly has zero cases for that
                    group or whether that that locale fails to report
                    demographics correctly.

                  Because there is currently no national vaccine demographic

                    states counts individuals who have received at least one

                    For the national numbers we use the population numbers

                    include population estimates from <b>Palau</b>,{" "}

                    which are difficult to find estimations for. Furthermore the
                    CDC has estimations for age ranges that the ACS numbers do
                    not readily provide, as they use a per year population
                    estimate from the ACS that we do not use anywhere else and
                    have not added to our system.

                  <li>
                    For the state level, to calculate the total number of
                    vaccinations we use the ACS 2019 estimates of each state’s
                    population. The population counts for each demographic group
                    at the state level are provided by the Kaiser Family
                    Foundation, who researched exactly what the definition of
                    each demographic group in every state is. They provide
                    population estimates for <b>Asian</b>, <b>Black</b>,{" "}
                    <b>White</b>, and <b>Hispanic</b>, so we fill in the ACS
                    2019 estimation for <b>American Indian and Alaska Native</b>
                    , and <b>Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander</b>. These
                    alternate population comparisons metrics shown with a
                    different color on the disparities bar chart. We are unable
                    to show a population comparison metric for “Unrepresented
                    Race” because we are unsure of the definition in each state.

                  be due to under-reporting rather than absence of impact.

                  In the definitions below, we use COVID-19 Cases as the
                  variable, and Race and Ethnicity as the demographic breakdown
                  for simplicity; the definitions apply to all variables and
                  demographic breakdowns.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Total COVID-19 cases per 100k people</b>: The total rate
                    of occurrence of COVID-19 cases expressed per 100,000 people
                    (i.e. 10,000 per 100k implies a 10% occurrence rate). This
                    metric normalizes for population size, allowing for
                    comparisons across demographic groups. This metric is
                    rounded to the nearest integer in the tracker.

                    </b>
                    : Within a locale, the percentage of COVID-19 cases that
                    reported unknown race/ethnicity. For example, a value of 20%
                    for Georgia means that 20% of Georgia's reported cases had
                    unknown race/ethnicity. This metric is rounded to one
                    decimal place. In instances where this would round to 0%,
                    two decimal places are used.

                  <li>
                    <b>Share of total COVID-19 cases</b>: The percentage of all
                    COVID-19 cases that reported a particular race/ethnicity,
                    excluding cases with unknown race/ethnicity. This metric is
                    rounded to one decimal place. In instances where this would
                    round to 0%, two decimal places are used.

                    <b>Population share</b>: The percentage of the total
                    population that identified as a particular race/ethnicity in
                    the ACS survey. This metric is rounded to one decimal place.
                    In instances where this would round to 0%, two decimal
                    places are used.

                  The combined race/ethnicity groups shown on the tracker can be
                  hard to understand, partially due to non-standard
                  race/ethnicity breakdowns across data sources. Generally, all
                  race/ethnicities on the tracker include Hispanic/Latino unless
                  otherwise specified.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We include a few example groups and definitions below. Note
                  that the complete definition of a race/ethnicity can only be
                  understood in the context of a particular dataset and how it
                  classifies race/ethnicity (e.g. the presence of "Other" within
                  a dataset changes who might be classified as "Asian" vs
                  "Other").
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>All</b>: Any race or ethnicity, including unknown
                    race/ethnicity.

                  <li>
                    <b>Asian (Non-Hispanic)</b>: A single race (Asian), not
                    Hispanic/Latino.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Hispanic/Latino</b>: Any race(s), Hispanic/Latino.

                  <li>
                    <b>Black or African American</b>: A single race (African
                    American), including those who identify as African American
                    and Hispanic/Latino.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Unrepresented race (Non-Hispanic)</b>: A single race not
                    tabulated by the CDC, not of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.
                    Individuals not identifying as one of the distinct races
                    listed in the source data, or multiracial individuals, are
                    grouped together as “Some other race”. This is a problem as
                    it obscures racial identity for many individuals. In our
                    effort to take transformative action towards achieving
                    health equity the Satcher Health Leadership Institute has
                    decided to rename this category to highlight it as a health
                    equity issue.
