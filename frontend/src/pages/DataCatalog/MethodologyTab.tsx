                    National statistics are aggregations of state-wide data. If
                    state data is not available, these aggregations may be
                    incomplete and potentially skewed.

                    When calculating national-level per100k COVID-19 rates for
                    cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, we only include the
                    population of states that do not have a suppressed case,
                    hospitalization, or death count as part of the total
                    population for each respective measure. See the 'What data
                    are missing' section for further details.

                    To protect the privacy of affected individuals, COVID-19
                    data may be hidden in counties with low numbers of COVID-19
                    cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

                    Decisions to suppress COVID-19 data for particular states in
                    the tracker are evaluated by comparing the aggregate case,
                    death, and hospitalization counts in the CDC surveillance
                    dataset vs other sources, such as the New York Times. Data
                    for a state are suppressed if the aggregate counts for that
                    state are &lt; 5% of the source being used for comparison.
                    These analyses are available for{" "}

                    The underlying data is reported at the case-level, so we
                    cannot determine whether a state/county lacking cases for a
                    particular demographic group truly has zero cases for that
                    group or whether that that locale fails to report

                  Because there is currently no national vaccine demographic

                    For the national numbers we use the population numbers

                    include population estimates from <b>Palau</b>,{" "}

                    which are difficult to find estimations for. Furthermore the
                    CDC has estimations for age ranges that the ACS numbers do
                    not readily provide, as they use a per year population
                    estimate from the ACS that we do not use anywhere else and

                    For the state level, to calculate the total number of
                    vaccinations we use the ACS 2019 estimates of each state’s
                    population. The population counts for each demographic group
                    at the state level are provided by the Kaiser Family
                    Foundation, who researched exactly what the definition of
                    each demographic group in every state is. They provide
                    population estimates for <b>Asian</b>, <b>Black</b>,{" "}
                    <b>White</b>, and <b>Hispanic</b>, so we fill in the ACS
                    2019 estimation for <b>American Indian and Alaska Native</b>
                    , and <b>Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander</b>. These
                    alternate population comparisons metrics shown with a
                    different color on the disparities bar chart. We are unable
                    to show a population comparison metric for “Unrepresented
                    Race” because we are unsure of the definition in each state.

                  which can result in slightly different results than those

                  categorizations are self-reported, and a legislator may be

                </h4>

                <p>
                  Incarceration is influenced by a blend of political forces,
                  laws, and public opinion. Laws that govern sentencing policies
                  and disenfranchisement of convicted felons are some of the
                  political forces that determine voter participation in the
                  justice-involved population.

                  The impact of incarceration on the health of the justice
                  involved lingers long after the period of incarceration is
                  over. Upon reentry into society, the lack of adequate access
                  to healthcare and the resources that engender health such as
                  health insurance coverage, housing, employment, the lack of
                  opportunities for upward advancement etc. further exacerbates
                  the health inequities experienced by this group.

                <p>
                  Jail includes all individuals currently confined by a local,
                  adult jail facility, but does not include individuals who are
                  supervised outside of jail or who report only on weekends. In
                  general, jail facilities incarcerate individuals who are
                  awaiting trial or sentencing, or who are sentenced to less
                  than 1 year.

                    County reports: Vera data, which we use for our county level
                    reports, restricts both the measured jail population and the
                    relevant total population to individuals aged <b>15-64</b>.

                  <b>Prison</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                  In general, prisons incarcerate individuals who have been
                  sentenced to more than 1 year, though in many cases prison can
                  have jurisdictional control of an individual who is confined
                  in a jail facility. Due to this overlap, we are currently
                  unable to present accurate rates of combined incarceration.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal
                  correctional officials over a incarcerated person, regardless
                  of where they are held. Our ‘Sex’ and ‘Race’ reports present
                  this jurisdictional population, while our ‘Age’ reports (due
                  to the limitations in the data provided by BJS) only display
                  the <b>sentenced</b> jurisdictional population.{" "}

                    military, or Indian Country facilities. This data is
                    disaggregated by race/ethnicity, age, and sex.

                  When presenting incarceration reports, we have chosen to
                  highlight the total number of confined children (in adult
                  facilities), rather than only including this information as
                  our standard “per 100k” rate. This decision was based on
                  several factors:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The lack of federal law regarding the maximum age of
                    juvenile court jurisdiction and transfer to adult courts
                    coupled with the variance in state-specific laws makes it
                    unfeasible to derive an accurate population base for
                    individuals that may be incarcerated in an adult prison or
                    jail facility. Because of this, any rate calculations for{" "}
                    <b>0-17</b> are comparing the{" "}
                    <b>number of prisoners under 18</b> proportional to the
                    entire population of children down to newborns, resulting in
                    a diluted incidence rate. This can be seen on national and
                    state-level jail reports, as BJS provides these figures
                    directly. In other reports, we have chosen not to calculate
                    the incidence rate and instead rely on the total number of
                    confined children to highlight this health inequity.

                  otherwise specified.

                  We include a few example groups and definitions below. Note
                  that the complete definition of a race/ethnicity can only be
                  understood in the context of a particular dataset and how it
                  classifies race/ethnicity (e.g. the presence of "Other" within
                  a dataset changes who might be classified as "Asian" vs
                  "Other").
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>All</b>: Any race or ethnicity, including unknown
                    race/ethnicity.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Asian (Non-Hispanic)</b>: A single race (Asian), not
                    Hispanic/Latino.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Hispanic/Latino</b>: Any race(s), Hispanic/Latino.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Black or African American</b>: A single race (African
                    American), including those who identify as African American
                    and Hispanic/Latino.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Unrepresented race (Non-Hispanic)</b>: A single race not
                    tabulated by the CDC, not of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.
                    Individuals not identifying as one of the distinct races
                    listed in the source data, or multiracial individuals, are
                    grouped together as “Some other race”. This is a problem as
                    it obscures racial identity for many individuals. In our
                    effort to take transformative action towards achieving
                    health equity the Satcher Health Leadership Institute has
                    decided to rename this category to highlight it as a health
                    equity issue.

                    <b>Two or more races & Unrepresented race (Non-Hispanic)</b>
                    : People who are either multiple races or a single race not
                    represented by the data source's categorization, and who are
                    not Hispanic/Latino.
