      <h4>Missing and suppressed COVID data</h4>
      <p>
        For COVID-19 related reports, this tracker uses disaggregated,
        individual{" "}
        <a href={urlMap.cdcCovidRestricted}>
          case level data reported by states, territories, and other
          jurisdictions to the CDC
        </a>
        . Many of these case records are insufficiently disaggregated, report an
        unknown hospitalization and/or death status, otherwise fail to provide a
        complete picture of COVID-19 and its overall impact. Due to the nature
        of surveillance data, we expect this data to become more complete over
        time and will use the Health Equity Tracker to record that progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        In accordance with our{" "}
        <Link to={METHODOLOGY_TAB_LINK}>methodology</Link>, we suppress this
        incomplete data and render some states grey for certain COVID-19 data
        types, as outlined below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cases, hospitalizations and deaths: <b>Northern Mariana Islands</b>,{" "}
          <b>Mississippi</b>, <b>West Virginia</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hospitalizations and deaths: <b>Hawaii</b>, <b>Nebraska</b>,{" "}
          <b>South Dakota</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hospitalizations: <b>Rhode Island</b>

        <li>
          Deaths: <b>Delaware</b>

        Note: The following states' case data for COVID-19 <i>are</i> included,
        but should be interpreted with caution since the cases reported may not
        be representative of the population at large.

          numbers for <b>Black,</b> <b>White</b>, <b>Asian</b>, and{" "}

          The Center for American Women in Politics (CAWP) dataset uses unique
          race/ethnicity groupings that do not correspond directly with the

          We are currently unable to locate reliable data on state legislature
          totals, by state, by year prior to 1983. For that reason, we cannot
          calculate rates of representation historically before that year.

          To protect personal privacy, prevent revealing information that might
