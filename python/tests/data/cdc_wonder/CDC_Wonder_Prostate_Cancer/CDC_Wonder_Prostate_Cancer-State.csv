1. Rows with zero Count are hidden. Use Quick Options above to show zero rows.,,,,,,,,,

Caveats:,,,,,,,,,
1. 'Not Applicable' is displayed for all data values when sex-specific cancers are combined with the wrong sex. More,,,,,,,,,
information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer-v2021.html#Genital Cancers List.,,,,,,,,,
2. 'Missing' is displayed for a combination of states/territories/MSAs and years that did not meet the United States Cancer,,,,,,,,,
Statistics (USCS) publication standard or did not allow permission for their data to be used.,,,,,,,,,
"3. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites or by Childhood Cancer, because aggregate",,,,,,,,,
values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be,,,,,,,,,
misleading.,,,,,,,,,
4. These states are missing data for the indicated year: Indiana 2020-2021; Mississippi 1999-2002; South Dakota 1999-2000;,,,,,,,,,
Puerto Rico 1999-2004.,,,,,,,,,
5. Puerto Rico's 2017 incidence counts and rates are based on the first six months of reported data (January to June 2017),,,,,,,,,
coupled with half of the population estimate. Cases with unknown month of diagnosis were included. Data from July to December,,,,,,,,,
2017 are excluded to account for the population shift that occurred due to Hurricane Maria.,,,,,,,,,
6. Data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet data quality criteria. Incidence data,,,,,,,,,
shown for the United States are diagnoses and populations from included registries only.,,,,,,,,,
"7. Information on primary site, behavior, and histology was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for",,,,,,,,,
"Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) and categorized according to the revised SEER recodes dated March 1, 2018, which define",,,,,,,,,
standard groupings of primary cancer sites.,,,,,,,,,
"8. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and",,,,,,,,,
Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for,,,,,,,,,
"these states, nor are these counts included in the summary populations for the affected division, regions or national",,,,,,,,,
"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005.",,,,,,,,,
